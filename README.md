# 1.15.2 Minecraft Winter Modding Competition

So I did a thing :D

## Features:

### Block & Food:
Added a Chocolate Block!

The chocolate block can be placed like any normal block. However you can also eat it. 
Furthermore, the Chocolate Block will melt if it is surrounded by Liquid chocolate (best seen underchocolate in the winter chocolate biome).

### Fluid:
Added Liquid Chocolate!

Liquid Chocolate can be placed using a Chocoate Bucket just like any other Fluid. It will eventually freeze and turn into a Chocolate Block if it is surrounded by atleast 3 pieces of Blue Ice. 

### Tile Entity:
Added a Fluid Pump!

The Fluid Pump can be placed above a source block of any fluid. The pump will then generate more of this fluid at 1mb/tick. This fluid can be harvested using a normal bucket.

### World:
Added a Winter Dimension!
Added a Winter Biome!

The winter dimension has oceans full of liquid chocolate and mountains made up of Chocolate Blocks and Snow blocks. 
(Access the world by using the forge command `/forge setdimension @p wintercomp:winter_dim`
 
### Living Enitity:
Added a Chocolate Golem!

Chocolate golmes are big boys that can be spawned using their spawn egg, or using the way cooler method; building them :D
Use the image below as a guide for how they should be built, be sure to finish by putting in the liquid chocolate!

*Note: They are not balanced for survival gameplay yet, just saying xD*

Chocolate Golems drop a Chocolate Core when killed.

### Item:
Added Chocolate Core!

The Chocolate Core is currently useless in the game :(, but you can have it as a reward for reading through this big file, here you go!

### Potion:
Added Potion of Hunger!

Its just a potion of hunger, I had more ideas, but ran out of time :( (has splash, lingering and tipped arrow variant aswell)
